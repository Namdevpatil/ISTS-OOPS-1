Java is an Object Oriented programming.

Object: is an real time entity, means when we create an object based on class, which will get
        memory allocation in RAM(Heap) memory.
        
Question: How we will create an Object in Java?

Answer: using 'new' keyword/operator

for example,


class Employee
{


}

Employee employee = new Employee();

Note: 'new' keyword will create an object/instance based on class, and allocates a new memory location.

about java class?

class: it a blueprint/template of a java Object.

Question: what are the properties there in class?

Answer: class contains fields/variables, constructors, blocks, behavior/methods and inner classes..etc.

	for example,

		public class Employee
		{		
			//fields
			private int employeeId;
			private String employeeName;
			private String employeeRole;
			
			//constructor
			public Employee()
			{
			
			}
			
			//methods
			public void getEmployeeData()
			{
				//call fields here and write logic			
			}
			
			//inner classes
			class Address
			{
				//inner class also has the properties like outer class.
			}
					
		}


Class properties:

1. Fields/variables:

In a class we have two different types of fields/variables

	=> non-static/instance fields/variables: 
	=> static/class fields/variables
